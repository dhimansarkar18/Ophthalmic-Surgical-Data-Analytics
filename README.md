# Opthalmic Surgical Data Analytics and Insights - Premier Eye Institue and Hospital in Bangladesh

In our preliminary research, our group discovered that childhood blindness effects an estimated 40,000 children in Bangladesh. Of those cases, an estimated 36% are treatable and another 32% are preventable (Gilbert & Muhit, 2012). While cataract disease in children is a fairly uncommon phenomenon in the West, cataract disease is responsible for almost all of these occurrences. In the age of modern medicine, it is a tragedy when a disease that is so debilitating goes untreated, especially in children. In this study, our focus was to analyze and gather insights from the primary dataset provided to us by Ispahani Islamia Eye Institute and Hospital headquartered in Bangladesh. The dataset contains data across three different hospital branches namely Dhaka, Barishal and Jamalpur. It includes important information regarding the patientâ€™s medical record number, category of intake, visitation date, surgery duration, and even the cost of the surgery. We proceeded to take the necessary steps for data cleaning by removing null values, duplicates, and outliers. Some new columns were added for further clarification. After visualizing, we discovered that children made up a sizeable number of cataract surgeries. Upon further research, we found that it is a prevalent issue in the Bangladeshi society where children commonly get affected with this condition leading to premature blindness.

We thought it would be both an interesting and important topic for analysis and discussion. We noticed a large percentage of cataract surgery cases affected children and constituted a large cross-section of the demographical data. Therefore, we decided to direct our focus on this specific issue and study the various trends-relationships across the different factors given to us in this dataset. Our objective for this project is to increase awareness amongst the people in Bangladesh in order to facilitate timely care and take preventive measures in order to reduce the negative impacts. We also provided some solutions to the organization and the stakeholders in Bangladesh to better address the challenges related to childhood cataract and seek a wider penetration for s providing a better eye care to those in need.

# Dataset

The data set can be downloaded via github:
